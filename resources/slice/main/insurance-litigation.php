            <div class="cols col-one">

Our lawyers have decades of experience in coverage analysis of even the most challenging questions.  Whether it is an impromptu call to run something by us or the need of a formal opinion, we are ready for your call.  </p>

            <h4>Case management</h4>
            <div class="cols col-one">
              <p>Legal disputes can be expensive.  The risks and cost of taking a case to trial must be weighed against the benefits.  We believe in candid and objective assessments of the risks from the perspective of experience.  We look forward to working with you to accurately assess your legal position. </p>

            <div class="cols col-one">

            <h4>Jury trials</h4>
            <div class="cols col-one">
              <p>Jury trials present unique risks to insurers.  Bad faith allegations can be inflammatory. Our lawyers have the jury trial experience and skill to confront these allegations and present them in ways to allow jurors to focus on the real issues and not be distracted by window-dressing.  Real court room experience is the key.</p>

            <h4>Bad faith claims</h4>
            <div class="cols col-one">
              <p>Oklahoma law requires insurers to use good faith in handling claims.  Allegations of bad faith raise the risk of punitive damages and bad precedent.  Our team has intensive, broad experience with CGL, auto, homeowners, trucking and maritime claims with national and international carriers.  With a focus on bad faith claims, we stay on top of the ever-changing laws that apply to these cases.  Let us discuss how we can help you.</p>
